In this directory you may find 4 files, each containing my answers to one part of the project (a gif, a jupyet notebook, a txt file that energies are written in it, and may contain a description text file).
Unfortunately, after one week of continuious working on the project, I could not get good results from the convolution method. So, I stick to the other method (calculating the forces), and got better results form that. So, all the results in the folders 1 to 4 , are those from this and there exists a file named "convolution" wich includes my unsuccessful attack on this method (After all the effort, I found that the problem comes from the potential calculator function, but sadly I could not solve it).
